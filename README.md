# Simple-Perception-Stack-for-Self-Driving-Cars
In this project we are going to create a simple perception stack for self-driving cars (SDCs.). Our only data source will be video streams from cameras for simplicity. Weâ€™re mainly going to be analyzing the road ahead, detecting the lane lines, detecting other cars/agents on the road, and estimating some useful information that may help other SDCs stacks.
